<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>This project investigates the ability to classify human activity (sitting, standing, etc) based on wearable accelerometers. The report shows an approach to using caret to model the data.</p>

<h2>Model Description</h2>

<p>The following shows the r code to load, parition, train, and evaluate the data.</p>

<pre><code>library(caret)

<h2>Exploratory Analysis / Variable Selection</h2>

<p>The first challenge was to determine which variables were relevant for the classification challenge.  All variables were evaluated by using summary on the data set.  This was not particularly revelaing, but it led to further investigation of the time fields.  Intuitively, it is reasonable to believe that time of day could impact exercise method, but using qplot there was little evidence to support this.  All of the timing/windowing variables were excluded from the model.  </p>

<p>Given the large number of variables, it was worth investigating if more variables could be removed.  I ran a command to find columns of zero or near-zero variance.  This led to the removal of about a third of the remaining variables.  </p>

<pre><code>nzv &lt;- nearZeroVar(training, saveMetrics = TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>A large number of indicators were still available for the model.  There was mild concern that there would be too many indicators, but they did provide classifying power.</p>

<h2>Model Selection Rationale</h2>

<p>A number of approaches were considered including rpart, lda, rf.  Given the large number of variables and the clear variable interactions shown during exploration, recursive partitioning and regression trees was selected.  Since the results appeared sufficient, further changes to the variables were not desired.</p>

<p>The models were run with 5-fold, 5 time cross validation.  Ideally, these numbers would be increased, but for performance (speed) they were left small.</p>

<h2>Uncertainty Analysis</h2>

<p>The results of the cross validation were quite good, as shown below.  The results were greater than 99% for accuracy, precision, recall.  There definitely is some concern about over-fitting the data.  In particular, while there is a large number of records for training they were derived from a much smaller set of individuals.  The results below represent the upper limit for performance and are likely to be lower on a different data set.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The result shows that this data is well suited for modeling because the variables do distinguish the various cases quite well.  The choice for variables and modeling approach here seemed suitable, but other approaches would have similar merit.</p>
